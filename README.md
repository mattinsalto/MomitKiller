Momit Home Thermostat replacement due to it's continuous problems.
  
Momit was a company that made connected thermostats through which you could turn on your home's heating remotely and other functionalities. Due to the malfunction of the devices, I decided to do something similar with a raspberry pi, a wifi switch and a relay. Today the company no longer exists, it broke in 2019. The project consists of an API made in Net Core and a client made in Xamarin. Later, I simplified the API project a bit and made a client in Angular. It is in the Thermostat repository along with all the information to DIY.
